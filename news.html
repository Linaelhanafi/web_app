                                                        and works of several women from historical and contemporary
                                                        Muslim contexts, including their intellectual insights, moral
                                                        courage, and egalitarian imaginations. In contrast to these, I
                                                        will critique the discourse of "Muslim girls and women" in
                                                        mainstream international development discourse, which portrays
                                                        them as damsels in distress who need rescue from oppressive
                                                        religion and men. These policy and research discourses often
                                                        treat Muslim feminists as exceptions, while they are viewed as
                                                        objects of charity. By contrasting these two portrayals, I will
                                                        examine the implications for global epistemic justice.</b></p>

                                                        women’s experiences in historical context. Therefore, drawing
                                                        from Assia Djebar’s and Fatima Mernissi’s
                                                        scholarship, we offer a new perspective that contests the
                                                        top-down hegemonic representations of women to
                                                        suggest a more inclusive bottom-up narrative.
                                                        We argue that by combining the disciplines of education,
                                                        sociology, and literary studies, it is possible to develop a
                                                        framework for understanding Maghrebi women’s experiences. <br>

                                                        Mernissi’s sociological contributions grapple
                                                        not only with the religious and cultural discourses that have
                                                        been utilized as justification for women’s exclusion
                                                        both from educational settings and from broader historical
                                                        understanding.
                                                        At the same time, she emphasizes through her fieldwork that
                                                        Maghrebi women view education as a liberatory
                                                        pathway.
                                                        We argue as well that Djebar’s narratives of education,
                                                        especially those in L’Amour, la Fantasia (1985), and Le blanc
                                                        de l’Algérie (1995), and Nulle part dans la maison de mon père
                                                        (2007) articulate a more expansive definition of
                                                        political and cultural engagement for women.
                                                        Both L’Amour and Nulle part attend to Djebar’s education, both
                                                        in the French colonial system and through Quranic
                                                        schools. In these texts, as well as Le blanc de
                                                        l’Algérie, we
                                                        find a vision for women’s education that surpasses
                                                        colonial and nationalist discourses. Indeed, Djebar
                                                        describes
                                                        her intellectual formation as a doubled site of exile
                                                        and emancipation. At the same time that she finds
                                                        herself
                                                        severed from an ultranationalist homeland, she situates
                                                        herself such that she can reflect upon the historical and
                                                        present struggles of Algerian women – including those
                                                        who did not receive a similar kind of education.
                                                        We also find an essential role for what Djebar calls Algérianité
                                                        (Algerianity), which understands Algerian
                                                        experience as interconnected – between cultures, faith systems,
                                                        and languages (Amazigh, Arabic, French, and
                                                        Djebar’s view of the body as language).
                                                        In all cases, Algerian women are upheld as agents for change,
                                                        particularly at the cultural and educational level.
                                                        Combined with our analysis of global citizenship, we believe
                                                        that this research can provide a key historical and
                                                        cultural insight – one that opens up the potential for the
                                                        “undoing and redoing” (Mignolo and Walsh, 2008)
                                                        necessary to confront oppressive discourses of modernity and

                                                    <p>The purpose of this talk is to examine the stories, biographies, and works of several women from historical and contemporary Muslim contexts, including their intellectual insights, moral courage, and egalitarian imaginations. In contrast to these, I will critique the discourse of "Muslim girls and women" in mainstream international development discourse, which portrays them as damsels in distress who need rescue from oppressive religion and men. These policy and research discourses often treat Muslim feminists as exceptions, while they are viewed as objects of charity. By contrasting these two portrayals, I will examine the implications for global epistemic justice.</p>

                                                        Surprisingly, this dropout trend is not due to a lack of

                                                        Although experiences vary depending on demographic, many

                                                    <p>The education of Muslims is the most important thing that Allah
                                                        asks of us and about which Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) has advised
                                                        us a lot. Islamic history has shown us that the first person who
                                                        accepted Islam was Khadija, the wife of our beloved Prophet
                                                        (pbuh). This incident not only prompted us to meditate, but also
                                                        shows us that Khadija herself, in addition to the faith she had
                                                        in her husband as a just and honest man, asked him to learn more
                                                        from the knowledge that began to be revealed to him by the

                                                        important part of the Prophet’s life, such as Fatimah and Aisha,
                                                        a daughter and a wife of the Messenger of Allah (pbuh),
                                                        respectively, who also were among the most popular female

                                                    <p>Many important women in Islamic history have been known as
                                                        initiators and supporters of knowledge. Such was the case of
                                                        Fatima Al-Fihri from the city of Kairouan in Tunisia, known as

                                                        during the history of Islam among Albanians, there are many
                                                        Albanian Muslim women who have been great supporters of various
                                                        knowledge. Meanwhile, only since the beginning of the 20th
                                                        century, when Albania was detached from the Ottoman Sultanate,
                                                        until today in 2023, many changes have taken place in the
                                                        Albanian society in Albania and in other Albanian lands,
                                                        including the education of Albanian Muslim women.</p>
                                                    <p>With the advent of the so-called “democracy” in 1990, immediately
                                                        after the fall of the infamous communist dictatorship in Albania
                                                        and with the restoration of freedom of religion and belief,
                                                        Albanian society entered a new stage of its history. Among the
                                                        many shortcomings for the improvement of the Albanian Muslim
                                                        society, there were also some “religious” thoughts coming from
                                                        some Arab countries, which strictly forbade the education of
                                                        Muslim women in universities and to study different branches of
                                                        science, adding more to the lack of culture among Albanian
                                                        Muslims and many of them have had problems with their parents or
                                                        spouses if they expressed themselves differently.</p>
                                                    <p>A change in this aspect happened on the eve of the 21st century
                                                        in the 2000s where many Albanian Muslim women managed to think
                                                        differently as Muslims and began to give more importance to
                                                        their own education in various branches of universities. This
                                                        also gave them an independence of thought and economy, being
                                                        able to think differently about the education of their children.

                                                    <p>But what were some of the historical reasons that were
                                                        experienced in this way by Albanian Muslim women and how can the
                                                        education of these women change more for the better from

                                                    <p>Access to education for girls in some of the Muslim majority
                                                        countries remains a critical and ongoing challenge yet.
                                                        Discriminatory cultural norms, gender-based violence, poverty,
                                                        and inadequate infrastructure continue to impede girls'
                                                        educational opportunities. However, amidst these challenges, the
                                                        figure of Malala Yousafzai has emerged as a prominent advocate
                                                        for girls' education. This research proposal aims to investigate
                                                        the role of Malala Yousafzai in advocating for girls' education
                                                        in Muslim majority countries, focusing on the challenges she
                                                        faced and the achievements she has attained.</p>
                                                    <p>Malala Yousafzai, a Pakistani activist and Nobel laureate, gained
                                                        global attention for her unwavering commitment to girls'
                                                        education. Born in the Swat Valley of Pakistan, Malala
                                                        experienced firsthand the restrictive policies of the Taliban,
                                                        who banned girls' education in the region. Despite facing grave
                                                        threats to her safety, she courageously spoke out against the
                                                        Taliban's oppressive regime and fought for the right of girls to
                                                        access quality education. In 2012, Malala survived a targeted
                                                        assassination attempt, which further propelled her cause onto

                                                    <p>This research proposal examines Malala Yousafzai's advocacy for
                                                        girls' education in Muslim majority countries, exploring the

                                                        barriers that still exist. It aims to identify future directions

                                                        intends to contribute to the existing knowledge on the promotion
                                                        of girls' education in Muslim societies and inform future

                                                        equality in education. The findings of this research can
                                                        potentially influence policies and interventions aimed at
                                                        improving educational opportunities for girls in Muslim
                                                        societies.</p>
                                                    <p>The research proposal employs a mixed-methods approach to examine
                                                        Malala Yousafzai's advocacy for girls' education in Muslim
                                                        majority countries. It includes a comprehensive literature
                                                        review of scholarly works. Thematic analysis will be used to
                                                        analyze qualitative data from the interviews, highlighting

                                                        advocacy. Additionally, quantitative data on girls' educational
                                                        access and outcomes in selected Muslim majority countries will
                                                        be collected and analyzed. This approach will provide a

                                                        institutions de facto. For this reason, Muslim countries are

                                                        wealth disparity among many others. The borrowed Western
                                                        education system, in most Muslim societies, systematically
                                                        embeds the idea of Western superiority in the minds of youth.

                                                        context of Muslim societies. The colonial mindset in Muslim
                                                        societies treats knowledge as an a priori set of rules. To aid

                                                    <p>In recent years, the intensity of emerging new issues and
                                                        challenges have become aggravated due to ‘post-normal times’.
                                                        The chief characteristics of ‘the 21st century’ are complexity,
                                                        inconsistency, and uncertainty. These are also the three driving
                                                        forces (3C’s) that push us to post-normal times in which we find
                                                        ourselves. Ziauddin Sardar explains the phenomena of the
                                                        uncertain and complex world humans inhabit in his post-normal
                                                        time theory. He defines post-normal time theory (PTN) as an
                                                        ‘in-between period where old orthodoxies are dying, new ones
                                                        have not yet emerged and nothing makes sense’ (Sardar, 2010:1).
                                                        Human civilization has entered an anthropogenic era whereby for
                                                        the first time in history, man-made hazards are the biggest
                                                        contributor to ecological destruction.</p>
                                                    <p>The challenges lying ahead are formidable for human civilization
                                                        in general and Muslim societies in particular. To overcome these
                                                        challenges there is a need to train, educate and empower youth.
                                                        This paper will use post-normal time theory and futures
                                                        methodology and argue that future literacy and social inclusion
                                                        of youth can help us achieve a more inclusive, equitable and
                                                        sustainable future for Muslim societies. Future literacy is
                                                        important to break out of the imprisoned mindset. To bring about
                                                        a real change there is a need to teach and train the young
                                                        generation to think outside the dominant materialistic paradigm.
                                                        This is possible only by embracing the complexity of the
                                                        problem, inculcating the skills of creative thinking, and giving
                                                        the youth confidence to challenge the status quo.</p>
                                                    <p>The paper will contend that the curriculum generally for all
                                                        disciplines and particularly for business schools is designed to
                                                        meet the needs of the industry and not the needs of society.
                                                        Since the motive of corporations and business is profit-seeking
                                                        in the short run and sustaining returns in the long run, the
                                                        concern for societies’ welfare becomes secondary. To make our
                                                        young generation agents of change, there is a need to
                                                        substantially transform the education system in Muslim
                                                        societies. An interdisciplinary approach must be adopted, new
                                                        disciplines must be introduced that cater to the need of
                                                        changing environment we live in. An ideal curriculum will help
                                                        us overcome our biases and current perception of what is
                                                        possible.</p>

                                                        curriculum.</p>
                                                    <p>Each of these three streams of education has three phases termed
                                                        primary, secondary, and higher secondary. The main objectives of
                                                        this article are to investigate the existing condition of the
                                                        participation of women in education-related activities and to
                                                        find out the challenges and their remedies as well. In
                                                        Bangladesh, women have started exercising greater influence in
                                                        almost all the sectors of state affairs such as administration,
                                                        business, government, politics, teaching, and other professions
                                                        but the participation of women at the decision-making level is
                                                        too narrow. Because of the social norms prevailing in Muslim
                                                        society and the cultural and social reality, the participation
                                                        of women in all sectors is far from mentionable.</p>
                                                    <p>But the participation of women in imparting education at the
                                                        three levels is very much satisfactory. Among others, 65% of
                                                        female teachers teach at the primary level and another 26% teach
                                                        at the secondary and higher secondary levels. The participation
                                                        of women in the Teachers' Training Centres is also encouraging.
                                                        Despite these, the sector is beset with problems. The
                                                        environment, social culture, and practices are still not
                                                        women-friendly. There are incidents of sexual harassment, mental
                                                        torture, and molestation at the workplace and financial
                                                        evaluation of their work is still not satisfactory.</p>
                                                    <p>Problems include working hours, vacations, positions, honorarium,
                                                        and job evaluation. We need to ensure a safe work environment,
                                                        proper evaluation, justified work hours, a sufficient number of
                                                        paid leaves, and daycare facilities for their children. A change
                                                        in social practices and outlook is also pivotal. Considering the
                                                        overall situation, this paper will discuss the prevailing
                                                        problems and offer solutions to the same and highlight the
                                                        significant participation of women. The methodology used in this
                                                        study is analytic in qualitative nature. The primary data has
                                                        been collected from various sources like published books,
                                                        journals, physical and online libraries. The study would be
                                                        useful for policymakers, academicians, researchers and so on.

                                                        education in the South Asian context. Throughout history,
                                                        knowledge has not only been viewed as an intellectual pursuit

                                                        extensive review of library resources on female seminaries in
                                                        other parts of the Muslim world.</p>
                                                    <p>The data gathered indicates that increased unemployment,
                                                        insecurity, and secularization in state-guided institutions have
                                                        motivated families to send their children to traditional female
                                                        seminaries for religious and aesthetic reasons. As a result,
                                                        practical pedagogical considerations have become less relevant
                                                        or even non-essential. However, many teachers and students are
                                                        calling for balanced reforms to meet international standards.
                                                        They believe that through well-planned adjustments, female
                                                        seminaries can play a major role not only in Bangladesh but also
                                                        in the broader region. Nonetheless, there are concerns that
                                                        pedagogical reforms in an era of increased secularization may
                                                        lead to the loss of aesthetic goals.</p>

                                                    <p>Among 1.4 billion Indians, Muslims make up 170.22 million,
                                                        including 80.3 million women. Several findings have concluded
                                                        that Indian Muslims are the worst-performing community in

                                                    Education Context</h4>
                                                <p>Muslim women play a key role in the workforce in Middle East and
                                                    North Africa (MENA) region. Women hold diverse positions, from
                                                    political leaders to senior leaders to educators, doctors, engineers
                                                    and many more. Yet, in many parts of the world, Muslim women are
                                                    perceived as oppressed because of the negative cultural narratives
                                                    that are embedded in the society and that which are often reiterated
                                                    in the media. In this paper, I share a counter narrative, an
                                                    empowering narrative of a female Muslim leader in higher education
                                                    context in Qatar where I examine her educational leadership
                                                    experiences and how she maneuvers her leadership role in light of
                                                    Islamic leadership theory and practice. The central question guiding
                                                    this study is: How does a female educational leader narrate her
                                                    leadership experience in higher education in Qatar?</p>
                                                <p>Literature on Islamic educational leadership is rapidly growing and
                                                    scholars have been studying it in different contexts and from a wide
                                                    variety of perspectives such as culturally relevant leadership
                                                    (Ezzani & Brooks, 2019), spiritual leadership (Egel & Fry, 2017),
                                                    educational leadership stories of Muslim women in Qatar (Amatullah,
                                                    2018, 2023), school culture (Lahmar, 2020), Muslim identity,
                                                    (Brooks, 2019; Ezzani & King, 2018), Islamic school leadership and
                                                    social justice (Ezzani et al., 2021), woman’s narratives around
                                                    gender and stereotypes about Islam (Alghamdi, 2007, 2012, 2022), and
                                                    balanced leadership model from an Islamic perspective (El Bassiouny,
                                                    2023; ElKaleh, 2023). For this study, I utilize Padela’s Islamic
                                                    leadership model which emerges from his extensive study of a
                                                    standard textbook of Hadith, Riyad al-Salihin.</p>
                                                <p>Padela (2015) concludes two main categories as characterizing Islamic
                                                    leadership: Modeling and directing behaviors such as personalized
                                                    leadership, relationship with God and humanity, treatment of people,
                                                    and adaptive leadership. The second conceptual category is
                                                    motivating followers to a theocentric worldview with behaviors such
                                                    as fidelity to God and His prophet (pbuh) and developing a
                                                    faith-based identity.</p>
                                                <p>To illuminate female Muslim leader’s experiences in Qatar, this study
                                                    employs interpretivist narrative research methods. I conducted
                                                    three, 60-minutes interviews and observed the leader to help
                                                    construct detailed stories of leaders’ lived experiences. Data was
                                                    thematically analyzed to reveal themes such as: personalized
                                                    leadership, treatment of people, adaptive leadership, relation with
                                                    God and humanity, fidelity to God and His prophet (pbuh), and
                                                    developing a faith-based identity highlighting the significance of
                                                    collaboration, consultation, empowerment, and relationship based on
                                                    trust and respect. While findings partially reiterated existing
                                                    literature, this study shed light on several unique contributions to
                                                    Muslim female leadership and embedding Islamic leadership in
                                                    leadership roles resulting in implications for practice and
                                                    research.</p>
                                                <p>The findings and contributions of this study have the potential to
                                                    inform the work of leaders, for female Muslim leaders, professional
                                                    development organizers, and for researchers to lead in Islamic
                                                    contexts or leaders serving Muslim population. The study is well

                                                    Muslim societies and investigates ways to break these barriers. The

                                                    leadership is still relatively low in many Muslim societies, despite

                                                    positions has been attributed to various factors, including cultural
                                                    norms, societal expectations, gender bias, and lack of access to

                                                        involved in educating prominent religious male scholars. They

                                                        social welfare activities. Women's active engagement in these
                                                        institutions allowed them to exert influence and contribute to

                                                        medieval Morocco were not confined to domestic or private
                                                        spheres. Some women held positions of political power and
                                                        engaged in diplomatic activities. They participated in political

                                                <p>Muslim women in the diaspora face unique challenges as they navigate
                                                    their educational journeys and seek to establish themselves as
                                                    leaders within their communities. This research proposal aims to
                                                    critically analyze the experiences of Muslim women scholars in the
                                                    diaspora and their transformative role in redefining education and
                                                    leadership. By examining the narratives of these women, their
                                                    strategies for empowerment, and the barriers they encounter, this
                                                    study seeks to shed light on the theoretical framework of
                                                    intersectionality and agency, showcasing real-life examples of
                                                    Muslim women who have successfully challenged marginalization and
                                                    emerged as influential voices in education and leadership roles.</p>
                                                <p>The theoretical framework of this research proposal draws on two key
                                                    concepts: intersectionality and agency. Intersectionality recognizes
                                                    that individuals experience multiple forms of oppression and
                                                    privilege based on their intersecting identities, such as gender,
                                                    race, religion, and nationality. Muslim women scholars in the
                                                    diaspora face complex layers of marginalization and discrimination,
                                                    necessitating an intersectional approach to understanding their
                                                    experiences. By examining how their identities intersect and
                                                    interact, we can gain insights into the nuanced ways in which they
                                                    navigate educational systems and shape their leadership
                                                    trajectories. Muslim women scholars in the diaspora exercise agency
                                                    by challenging existing power structures, defying stereotypes, and
                                                    actively shaping their educational and leadership paths. Their
                                                    agency allows them to redefine education and leadership within their
                                                    communities, challenging traditional norms and creating spaces for
                                                    inclusive and equitable practices.</p>

                                                    and leadership will be explored. Purposive sampling will be used to
                                                    ensure diverse representation across geographic locations, cultural
                                                    backgrounds, and fields of study. A few exemplary Muslim women
                                                    scholars will be selected in the diaspora to conduct detailed case

                                                    roles within their communities. Qualitative methods such as
                                                    interviews, document analysis, and observation will be employed to
                                                    gather rich data. Recurring themes and patterns in the qualitative
                                                    data collected from interviews, focus groups, and case studies will
                                                    be identified through thematic analysis. An intersectional lens will
                                                    be employed to understand the complex interplay of identities and
                                                    experiences.</p>

                                                    reflects women's voices. The findings open the door for educators
