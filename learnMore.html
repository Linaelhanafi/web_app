                                    science,
                                    public affairs, religious studies, gender studies, and sociology) in formal and

                                    The terms “Muslim” and “education” are defined broadly to be inclusive. By
                                    “Muslim,” we mean any self-identifying Muslim individuals, institutions,
                                    communities, and societies and their roles in experiencing and shaping education
                                    as well as researchers interested in Muslim societies. “Education” includes the
                                    pedagogies, practices, and policies, as well as the conditions and status of
                                    human development and curriculum as they relate to Muslim societies and
                                    communities.

                                    <em><strong>“Universities in Muslim societies: A call for resistance and
                                            responsibility”</strong></em><i></i>
                                </p>
                                <p><i>A university is at risk when it fails to see itself as a place of argumentation,
                                        resistance, and responsibility. For universities in Muslim societies, this risk
                                        is compounded when one considers the ethico-religious responsibilities placed on
                                        what it means to be educated. In this presentation, I argue for a preparedness
                                        to being reflectively open to new considerations and fusions of knowledge; a
                                        pedagogy of resistance&nbsp;and dissent that could enhance intellectualism; and
                                        a responsiveness to broader social malaises&nbsp;as a fulfilment of
                                        education&nbsp;as a human responsibility.</i></p>

                                    or informs policy making and practical actions. In this study, content analysis of
                                    14 documents purposely sampled from journal, newspaper, articles, and book chapters
                                    by Nigerian scholars concerned with TVET issues, was made. Result of the analysis
                                    was tabulated for easy reference.</p>
                                <p>Results of the analysis reveals that the curriculum for TVET at various levels of
                                    education in Nigeria, which applies to the Muslim societies mostly found in northern
                                    Nigeria, does not adequately meet the current needs of the labour market and the
                                    communities it was meant to serve. Furthermore, its formulation or review requires
                                    the participation of community members as well as the inclusion of diverse societal
                                    goals and values. The policy implication for this study is a recommendation for a
                                    community-based curriculum that will supplement the national TVET curriculum and
                                    meet the needs of the Muslim societies.</p>

                                        Policy–An Educational Approach&nbsp;(Joining virtually)</strong></p>
                                <p>“Science culture” and “scientific literacy” are important but largely under-studied
                                    areas that have crucial implications for both education (curricula and pedagogy) and
                                    policy-making and policy implementation in the Muslim world and beyond.</p>
                                <p>We led an effort to assess the state of science culture and scientific literacy in
                                    the Muslim world both qualitatively and quantitatively by coordinating a Task Force
                                    on the Culture of Science in the Muslim World between 2017 and 2019. The Task Force
                                    assembled a group of scholars - scientists, policymakers, educationists,
                                    communicators, and journalists, who wrote essays on various aspects of the topic.
                                    The Task Force also conducted an online survey of scientific literacy and science
                                    culture in the Muslim world; it was completed by over 3500 respondents (in three
                                    languages - English, Arabic, and Urdu) to fuel and substantiate the views of the
                                    Task Force members. The essays, the survey results, the analyses, and a general
                                    overview constituted the report from the Task Force.</p>
                                <p>This paper presents a brief overview of the conclusions that were drawn from the work
                                    of the Task Force.</p>
                                <p>The general results of the science literacy part of the survey showed that the
                                    average respondent scored at least as high as the average of many OCED countries
                                    where such surveys are routinely conducted. Since our (online) audience is not
                                    random and is likely to represent more scientifically literate and well-connected
                                    individuals, we must conclude that this represents an upper bound on science
                                    literacy. In terms of 'attitudes towards science' the survey found a very
                                    interesting trend: those who filled the survey in their native language (Arabic or
                                    Urdu) were likely to hold more extreme positions than those who filled the survey in
                                    English.</p>
                                <p>Finally, on the science 'culture' part, which was measured via a set of statements
                                    designed to probe the extent to which respondents internalised the true essence of
                                    science (its goals and methods), we found some even more dramatic effects of the
                                    language in which the respondents took the survey: those who answered the survey in
                                    English (not their native language) had a diametrically opposite view to those who
                                    did that in Urdu/Arabic (their native language). This is quite an unexpected result
                                    and, if validated by additional studies, will have far-reaching consequences for
                                    both science education and media in the Muslim World.</p>
                                <p>Specifically, we believe that what the study captured are differences in the quality
                                    of education and exposure of these two populations within the Muslim World: - one,
                                    those who are well-educated, master the English language, and are conversant with
                                    English-speaking (scientific) media seem to understand the nature of science, and
                                    two, those who are educated in local languages and consume mostly local-language
                                    media and seem to misunderstand science and develop more extreme views on it. It is
                                    also worth noting here that, other than the language in which the survey was
                                    attempted, no other characteristic (education, wealth, etc.) seem to make much of a
                                    difference in measures of science literacy, attitudes, and culture.</p>
                                <p>These findings are preliminary at best and need to be properly evaluated and
                                    validated through more representative and rigorous surveys. However, at face value,
                                    this study’s results may have momentous implications for both education and media
                                    policy in the Muslim World as they imply our inability to communicate important
                                    scientific ideas and methods through local language educational and/or media
                                    content. This necessitates a deeper understanding and appreciation of what gets
                                    consumed in English and Arabic/Urdu language science classrooms and media and how to
                                    fix it.</p>

                                        virtually)</strong></p>
                                <p>The Qatar National Vision 2030 lists an educated population as an outcome of its
                                    human development pillar. This includes its mission to sustainably meet the needs of
                                    this generation and future generations through improved educational curricula and
                                    programs that foster Qatari moral and ethical values and a sense of belonging and
                                    citizenship. This vision is guided by strong Islamic and family values, which are
                                    pivotal as Qatar identifies as an Arab and Islamic nation. Qatar is also a part of
                                    the global effort to meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United
                                    Nations, which include similar concepts of global citizenship and appreciation of
                                    cultural diversity. These values are embedded in SDG 4, which aims to "ensure
                                    inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning
                                    opportunities for all". With Qatar’s efforts to meet the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
                                    Development as well as its expressed commitment to the Qatar National Vision 2030,
                                    there is a need for an evaluation tool to ensure that these goals are materializing
                                    in the public school education curriculum.</p>
                                <p>Thus, the purpose of this paper is to localize an evaluation tool to the Qatari
                                    context and to examine the extent that the public school curriculum in Qatar
                                    overlaps with the UN’s SDGs, particularly SDG 4. This mapping activity is critical
                                    to ensure Qatar’s curriculum reflects its goals through monitoring and qualitative
                                    assessment.</p>
                                <p>We will adapt the University of Auckland SDG Keywords Dictionary Project word list in
                                    order to gauge curriculum quality in Qatar. The word list is based on Elsevier’s SDG
                                    search query. While the keywords are relatively holistic, we aim to further include
                                    keywords that are informed by national regulations including the Qatar National
                                    Vision 2030 that address Qatar’s specific concerns including the emphasis on
                                    enhancing Arab and Islamic values and identity. MAXQDA will be used to conduct a
                                    content analysis. Our analysis will be restricted to public schools as the curricula
                                    working under centrally determined guidelines would demonstrate the progress accrued
                                    towards sustainable development in Qatar. The curriculum will be found through
                                    published documents on Qatar’s Ministry of Education and Higher Education website as
                                    well as documents collected directly from schools. The analysis used would provide a
                                    means of assessing the current state of the educational curricula in Qatar, which
                                    can be reused and revised in the future as the documents get updated. We expect that
                                    the results will highlight sustainable practices in Qatar as well as any gaps that
                                    can be addressed. We expect this to facilitate policy makers in their efforts to
                                    embed sustainable development practices into Qatar’s public school curriculum in
                                    order to achieve SDG 4. The keywords used may also be used and adapted by other

                                        virtually)</strong></p>
                                <p>Education systems in Muslim-majority countries have begun to address questions of
                                    multi-religious citizenship even if their focus squarely remains on Islamic identity
                                    formation and self-affirmation. Indonesia's state Islamic higher education system is
                                    a productive site for researching conceptualizations of religious diversity. The
                                    state system's long history of intellectual openness and instructional innovation
                                    has made it an integral element of Indonesian civil-pluralist Islam. Specifically,
                                    the state system's Religious Studies programs (Perbandingan Agama) have promoted an
                                    inclusive view of religious diversity and fostered interreligious cooperation. In
                                    the period of Indonesia's democratic transformation and consolidation, however, the
                                    programs' contributions to interreligious harmony have been complicated by the
                                    broader societal debate over the future of Islam in Indonesia. This debate takes
                                    place in a context of increasing accusations of heterodoxy. Moreover, challenges
                                    such as competition for funds and the program's negative image among outsiders have
                                    given rise to curricular initiatives rethinking the field's status and role in the
                                    context of state Islamic higher education.</p>
                                <p>A curriculum analysis of Religious Studies programs at thirteen state Islamic
                                    universities and colleges across several Indonesian provinces, the article examines
                                    the conceptualizations of religious pluralism that inform the study of religion in
                                    these programs. Following Popkewitz, the study views the curriculum as a site of
                                    social interests and conflicts where political and epistemological norms vie for
                                    legitimacy. Therefore, interviews with program administrators and instructors about
                                    the curriculum and course design process complement the analysis. Finally, the data
                                    is discussed in relation to 1) differing approaches to the study of religion and
                                    varying patterns of active engagement and interaction across religious lines; 2) the
                                    history of religious studies, which from its beginnings in the 1960s has included
                                    openly theological and dialogical elements; 3) the ongoing process of institutional
                                    transformation into full-fledged universities; and 4) Indonesia's increasingly
                                    polarized public debate over religious pluralism and the proper role and function of
                                    the State Islamic Higher Education system.</p>
                                <p>The article suggests that the programs' relative success in defending their place in
                                    the transforming field of Islamic state higher education in Indonesia is not simply
                                    due to its proponent's willingness to creative pedagogical innovation. Nor is it
                                    Muslim educators' ability to justify their inclusive views under reference to
                                    foundational Islamic concepts such as human dignity, equality, and social justice.
                                    Instead, what stands out is that defenders of Religious</p>
                                <p>Studies programs increasingly assert the public priority of their vision of Islam
                                    under reference to the Pancasila, Indonesia's foundational state philosophy and its
                                    de-facto civil religion—a strategy also found in other sectors of Indonesian society
                                    in response to hardliner’s infringement on the public sphere. By highlighting how
                                    educators draw on the Pancasila as a source of cultural legitimacy and power to
                                    defend their position, the article contributes to a fuller understanding of the
                                    relationship between Islamic and broader cultural norms for advancing
                                    multi-religious citizenship in Islamic higher education in Indonesia and beyond.</p>

                                <p><strong>Gender Bias in Bangladeshi School Textbooks: Not Just a Matter of Politics or
                                        Growing Influence of Islamist (Joining virtually)</strong></p>
                                <p>Improved access to female secondary school is widely perceived to reduce gender
                                    inequality in a wide range of socio-economic outcomes in developing countries.
                                    However, schools per se can reinforce patriarchal gender roles through hidden
                                    curriculum, especially gender-biased textbooks. This study critically reflects on
                                    the ongoing controversy over Islamization of textbooks by a secular government in
                                    Bangladesh. We have critically reviewed contents of textbooks used at the secondary
                                    education level across three education mediums in Bangladesh - secular school,
                                    recognized (i.e. Aliyah) madrasah and unrecognized (i.e. Quami) madrasah- with a
                                    focus on gender stereotypes. For comparison purposes, contents of older textbooks
                                    are contrasted with revised editions that are based on new national educational
                                    policy. We apply quantitative content analysis technique to analyze 1,507 pages of 8
                                    textbooks in total. Based on a review of the emerging evidence on gender stereotypes
                                    in textbook contents, we argue that gender bias was widespread in
                                    government-recognized textbooks long before radical Islamic groups publicly demanded
                                    changes to the secular school curriculum. All Bangladeshi school textbooks continue
                                    to suffer from a pro-male bias regardless of whether they are based on a secular or
                                    religious curriculum. Overall female representation is consistently low –two thirds
                                    (i.e. 62.8%) of the characters used in textbooks are male. Besides, there is hardly
                                    any improvement in the exclusion/invisibility of female characters over time.
                                    Nonetheless, Bangladesh’s experience suggests that politicization of the debate on
                                    what children should learn in school can make future reforms much harder to achieve.

                                    practices. From the early childhood years on, the basis of our eating practices are
                                    set in the different situations in which we learn how to eat. In the context of
                                    early childhood education food plays a vital role. What children eat and how they
                                    eat is coined by different factors. For example, in Berlin’s kindergarten, food can
                                    be veggi, halal or intercultural. In my contribution, I show how educators working
                                    in primary education create a space in which they pass on eating practices. In this
                                    process, food and ways of eating are a medium of their own convictions in relation
                                    to those of the dominant discourses around “the good meal”.</p>

                                        Identities&nbsp;(Joining virtually)</strong></p>
                                <p>Parents make choices for their kids every single day, choices about food, clothes,
                                    books, sports, screen time, games, etc. One of the biggest choices that parents have
                                    to make is which school their children will attend. Schools are the first and most
                                    prominent socialization site for children outside of their family unit. It is where
                                    children learn to develop their own identity and how to relate to others. In Canada,
                                    an increasing number of Muslim parents choose to send their children to Islamic
                                    schools. Due to the current political climate and the many stereotypes that Muslims
                                    have to challenge and navigate on a daily basis, many parents view Islamic schools
                                    as safe spaces where children get to freely explore and construct their own
                                    identities.</p>
                                <p>However, given schools’ importance in children’s socialization, faith-based schools
                                    in general and Islamic schools in particular have come under public scrutiny and
                                    suspicion as ethnic enclaves that putatively create a ghettoized population. For
                                    example, American author Amy Gutmann (1996) argues that all cultural or faith-based
                                    schools promote a “separatist multicultural perspective” and that they are “designed
                                    primarily to sustain the self-esteem of students on the basis of their membership in
                                    a separatist culture” (as cited in Zine, 2009, 42). Meanwhile, Canadian journalist
                                    Lois Sweet (1997) argues that most faith-based schools emphasize the differences
                                    between religions, which hinders students’ integration into the wider society and
                                    accentuates their “otherness.” Popular media amplifies those criticisms where Muslim
                                    schools are portrayed as “always already sectarian, partial and exceptional”, in
                                    contrast to public schools, which are imagined as “always already universal,
                                    impartial and normal” (Kymlicka, 2019, 973).</p>
                                <p>Despite these fears and suspicions, there are few studies that examine the graduates
                                    of Islamic schools. This research examines the outcome of these schools, which is
                                    their graduates and the relationship between Islamic education in Canada and Muslim
                                    youth identity development and integration into Canadian society. Through the lens
                                    of rooted cosmopolitanism, I aim to explore how those Muslim youth conceptualize
                                    their multifaceted identities after graduating from the Islamic school system.
                                    Rooted Cosmopolitanism as a theory recognizes that individuals have a multitude of
                                    overlapping identities that go beyond the traditional understanding of space and
                                    nationality. Rooted Cosmopolitanism also acknowledges that attachments to particular
                                    communities might be a crucial step in developing one’s sense of morality and
                                    responsibility to others.</p>
                                <p>This study adopts a qualitative approach, where I interviewed 30 Muslim youth aged
                                    18-34, who graduated from Canadian Islamic schools. Through the youth’s sharing of
                                    their experience in Islamic schools and the way they currently define their
                                    identity, this research will highlight the role that Islamic schools play in
                                    constructing their unique Canadian Muslim identities. Analyzing the lived experience
                                    of Muslim youth will not only benefit the religious education academic field but
                                    also it will teach us much about the integration of religious newcomers and members
                                    of minority religious groups in Canadian society and contribute to public debates
                                    often dominated by xenophobia.</p>

                                <p>We are supposed to obey various requirements in our life such as requirements which
                                    are set by governments, companies, schools, universities, families, and hundreds of
                                    other legislator institutions.</p>
                                <p>Psychological theories of obsessions and compulsions have long recognized that strict
                                    religious codes and moral standards might influence the content and intensity of
                                    obsessional symptoms (e.g., Fitz, 1990; Rachman &amp; Hodgson, 1980). In spite of
                                    some contradictory findings (e.g., Rapheal, Rani, Bale, &amp; Drummond, 1996;
                                    Steketee, Quay, &amp; White, 1991; Tek &amp; Ulug, 2001), most empirical studies
                                    have found a positive association between religiosity and obsessive-compulsive
                                    disorder symptoms (e.g., Abramowitz, Deacon, Woods, &amp; Tolin, 2004; Sica, Novara,
                                    &amp; Sanavio, 2002; Yorulmaz, Gencoz, &amp; Woody, 2009). However, the causal
                                    process responsible for this elevated obsessionality in highly religious individuals
                                    is largely unknown, nor is it known whether this relationship is evident in other
                                    religious faiths such as Islam. (Inozu, Karanci &amp; Clark: 2012)</p>
                                <p>Feeling ashamed is another problem caused by religious strictness. As self-conscious
                                    emotions, shame is at the heart of pathology and developmental psychology.
                                    (Kashanaki &amp; Keshmiri: 2019). Shame in this paper is a feeling that makes you
                                    feel as if you are a bad person.</p>
                                <p>Since a large number of scholars have previously analyzed the relationship between
                                    mental health and religion by using psychological methodology in all over the world,
                                    in this paper I do not repeat this examination because my goal is not to analyze the
                                    harm caused and I only I want to know whether children learn these requirements at
                                    school or from their families? And I also want to know if there is a trace of
                                    compulsion to perform Islamic requirements in the Qur'an or not? For this purpose,
                                    by focusing on the verses of the Qur'an, I investigate the attitude of the Qur'an in
                                    the implementation of Islamic requirements by the people. Does the Qur'an leave the
                                    people of the society free to comply with Islamic requirements or does it force them
                                    to obey through threats?</p>

                                <p>Literacy is a practice of who we are, and it defines our identity and reflects our
                                    way of belonging to a group. The way we speak and are spoken to helps shape who we
                                    are (Shor, 1999, p.2). According to Gee (1989), there are several discourses and
                                    literacy is the control of using language in secondary discourses. Gee (1989) refers
                                    to discourse as “socially accepted ways of using language, of thinking, of acting
                                    that can be used as identification of social group”. While primary discourse refers
                                    to home literacies, secondary discourses refers to literacies learned in school.
                                    Children from non-mainstream communities often do not get a chance to practice the
                                    school literacies at home (Gee, 1989). This circumstance might cause non-mainstream
                                    children to be defined as disadvantaged in school literacies as well. This paper
                                    focuses on children from Muslim communities considering them as non-mainstream
                                    communities. This research aims to understand how children from Muslim communities
                                    reflect their social-cultural backgrounds when they are given the opportunity to
                                    engage in multimodal literacy practices.</p>
                                <p><strong>Esra Ibil</strong>, is a third-year doctoral student at Indiana University's
                                    School of Education on a scholarship provided by her native Republic of Turkiye. She
                                    had worked with minority groups and taught Turkish in Istanbul, Turkiye, before
                                    attending graduate school. When she was a teacher, she incorporated the arts into
                                    literacy lessons and saw firsthand what strong and inclusive tools the arts are.
                                    Since then, she has been exploring how arts could be introduced into schools and
                                    used to empower children from all backgrounds. She therefore pursues a degree in
                                    Arts Education with a minor in literacy, culture, and language education.</p>

                                        Egypt (Joining virtually)</strong></p>
                                <p>Grounded in a holistic view of the learner as a whole human being mentally,
                                    emotionally, and psychologically, this study explores the transformative potential
                                    of FIRST, a new learner experience framework that promotes active deep
                                    learning(Bahgat et al, 2018), within a higher education setting. The study aims at
                                    investigating the framework’s potential breadth of real-life impact in a
                                    longstanding institution such as an Islamic University in Egypt. Based on the
                                    reflective experience of a university professor, the study attempts to address the
                                    following question: How is FIRSTframework transforming the learning experience in a
                                    traditional university setting taking into account the teacher student relationship?
                                    To comprehensively address this question, the research adopts a mixed methods
                                    approach by primarily employing interviews, surveys and observations of pre-recorded
                                    videos.</p>
                                <p>The holistic view of the learner stems from an Islamic viewpoint that
                                    regardseducation as one that involves the human being from a holistic perspective,
                                    rationally, spiritually and socially, and is based on the very notion of tawhid
                                    (oneness) in Islam (Cook, 1999). This holistic view of the human being is also
                                    represented by FIRST framework that attends to the learner as a whole human being
                                    attending to not only the mind and intellectual needs of the students but also
                                    looking at the learner’s emotional state as one that impedes learning. Based on five
                                    core domains, FIRST framework involves “focusing” on each individual learner’s needs
                                    while trusting the learner and what he/she brings to the learning experience’
                                    “interacting” within positive group dynamics ensuring a positive safe environment
                                    within the group learning process; “reviewing” the learning activities, where real
                                    learning happens through reflection after activities in active deep experiential
                                    learning; “sequencing”the learning activities to engage and motivate the learner;
                                    and finally “transforming”learning into action through application (Bahgat et al,
                                    2018). This study explores the dynamics and teacher student interactions that take
                                    place within the classroom as a result of the application of the key domains of this
                                    framework.</p>
                                <p>Throughout an experience that witnesses transition moments of a de-tyrannizing
                                    pedagogy involving an interplay of the heart and mind, and planting the seeds of a
                                    teacher student relationship that could blossom to reclaim the role of the muraby in
                                    the Islamic heritage in light of a “humanizing pedagogy” (Freire, 1970, p. 55), this
                                    study has found FIRST to promote change through a framework that has the capacity to
                                    instigate a paradigm shift in how the teacher reconceptualised his/her role
                                    re-envisioning the image of the student. The program has a transformative impact on
                                    the educators’ mindsets and mental paradigms. Moreover, in the most traditional
                                    learning environments, the smallest dynamic and heart-based changes can create
                                    ripples of change, for when reshaping the relationships between the facilitator and
                                    the students into one based on positivity, respect and reciprocal dialogue, positive
                                    change is experienced. Finally, FIRST presents a framework that transforms the
                                    classroom to gyrate around the learner and, thus, could be incorporated by educators
                                    who believe in empowering theoretical frameworks such as critical pedagogy but often
                                    grapple with how theory could be translated into practice.</p>

                                <p>According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, by 2019 the unemployment
                                    rate among youth (18-29 years) in Palestine reached 38%--31% among males and 63%
                                    among females--with 63% of the unemployed from the Gaza Strip compared to 23% from
                                    the West Bank. According to the Center of Youth for Economic Development, this is
                                    because young people are not properly equipped with the right skills to meet the
                                    demands of the labor market. Vocational Training Centers (VTCs) can help meet labor
                                    market demands, but vocational training in the West Bank and Gaza Strip suffers from

                                    specialties available to males and females. According to the Ministry of Labor
                                    (2014/2015) 31% of vocational training center enrollees were females compared to 69%

                                    generally preferred gender-traditional courses, for example beauty and sewing for
                                    females and mechanics and carpentry for males. However, some girls wanted to join
                                    mechanics, and some males wanted to enter the beauty profession. The lack of career
                                    guidance opportunities and a lack of attention to gender norms, has contributed to
                                    reluctance of females to engage in new disciplines suited to the changes and
                                    opportunities of the times.</p>
                                <p>The EquipYouth program addressed shortfalls in employability and career training
                                    services by building a bridge between the existing VTC trainings and labor market
                                    needs. Beginning in 2015, Equip Youth worked with the Ministry of Labor to integrate
                                    life skills and career guidance as part of the standard curricula to help young
                                    women and men identify their career paths and build their skills. By equipping
                                    teachers and staff with knowledge, skills and attitudes, they were better able to
                                    provide students the soft and practical skills they need to more successfully
                                    transition and compete in the labor market. The life skills curriculum included
                                    positive mindset (e.g. self-confidence), higher order thinking (e.g., critical
                                    thinking), interpersonal skills (e.g., communication) and community mindset (e.g.,
                                    empathy). Through EquipYouth, the Gaza VTCs administration officially integrated a
                                    comprehensive course of life skills and career guidance into their program plans,
                                    naming the course “Professional Culture.” Professional Culture will be given to all
                                    students of the Gaza VTCs and is a requirement for graduation. Through this
                                    transformative system change, Professional Culture has the potential to reach tens
                                    of thousands of young women and men in the future. This is particularly critical in
                                    Gaza where the need for life skills training among young people is increasing as a
                                    result of the pandemic, and as youth are experiencing higher depression and suicide
                                    rates. This paper will also describe the observed changes in choices female and male
                                    students make after career guidance. Our ultimate aspiration is that VTCs provide
                                    vocational training specialties for both men and women, so that everyone—regardless
                                    of gender—will be trained and employed using the latest technologies in a wide range
                                    of professions and with the soft skills to serve them throughout their lives.</p>

                                <p>Higher education can be regarded as a high level or a specialized form of human
                                    capital, the contribution of which to economic growth is very significant. Thus
                                    Higher education is an important form of investment in human capital. It is rightly
                                    regarded as the “engine of development in the new world economy” (Castells, 1994).
                                    However, there are challenges faced by students in continuing higher education
                                    studies. They even leave the university unwillingly due to the increased cost of
                                    education fees as a result of global financial crisis. Indeed, Turkish government
                                    allocates enormous amount of spending on education. Turkey known to be the one of
                                    few countries that offers full scholarships for international students (Aras &amp;
                                    Mohammed, 2019). It is also important to mention that Turkey is among the few
                                    countries offering free education for locals. Essentially, this study aims to
                                    investigate the university identity in the eyes of international students as well as
                                    significant antecedents related to the dependent variable of this study.</p>
                                <p>The constructs of this study include emotional intelligence, academic excellence,
                                    religiosity, self-efficacy, reciprocity and university identity. Age and gender as a
                                    moderating variables will be tested in order to further understand the demographic
                                    influence. This research, especially, addresses the literature gap in terms of
                                    technological acceptance towards acquiring education by international students. In
                                    the learning process, technology is becoming an integral part of higher education
                                    systems. This study is curious about the usage and international students acceptance
                                    level of technological tools and applications in Turkish universities. With that
                                    respect, does students’ social life declined through technology embedded education?
                                    This study develops the research model through integrating social identity theory
                                    (MacKay et al., 2019) and technology acceptance model in the context of higher
                                    education (Estriegana, 2019).</p>

                                <p>Teacher education plays an important role in Algerian society. Through its 11
                                    institutions distributed in different parts of the country, teacher education
                                    schools work on providing both academic and professional training for their
                                    pre-service teachers in humanities and exact sciences. As far as English teachers
                                    are concerned, they receive a four-years training for middle school teachers, and
                                    five years training for future high school teachers. The content of instruction
                                    focuses on developing students’ linguistic and cultural skills in the first two
                                    years, moving to more pedagogical and methodological competences in the two or three
                                    years that follow. The training cycle is crowned as a ‘practical’ training course
                                    involving the trainees in real teaching tasks in middle/high schools, in addition to
                                    a research paper preparation for future high school teachers.</p>
                                <p>During the pandemic crisis, the Algerian government announced the closing of all
                                    educational institutions and the adoption of e-learning as an official form of
                                    instruction in March 2020. Accordingly, Algerian universities shifted from 100%
                                    face-to-face teaching during the first term of the year, to 100% online instruction
                                    in the second term. In the following two years, Blended learning has been introduced
                                    in all Algerian higher education institutions, mixing both modes of instruction
                                    based on a pre-established schedule that took into consideration the availability of
                                    human and physical resources in each university. These rapid changes have had an
                                    impact on the methods of instruction as well as on the quality of the training
                                    provided by teacher education institutions.</p>
                                <p>The present paper aims at shedding light on the Algerian experience with teacher
                                    training during the pandemic crisis. The study focuses on the challenges faced by
                                    both teachers (teacher trainers) and students (pre-service teachers) at l’Ecole
                                    Normale Supérieure ‘Assia Djebar’, Constantine (ENSC), one of the biggest teacher
                                    education schools in the country. The tools of data collection include an analysis
                                    of trainees’ training reports and a questionnaire for supervisors (teacher trainers
                                    at l’ENSC). Results have shown that ‘social distancing’, a safety measure taken by
                                    decision makers during the pandemic, has had a negative impact on the students’
                                    training in terms of reduced time for the training, lack of interaction between
                                    mentors and trainees, and difficulty in coping with Blended learning.&nbsp;</p>

                                        Through Graduate Studies Abroad (Joining in-person)</strong></p>
                                <p>This paper explores early findings from an in-progress research study focused on the
                                    experiences of female graduate students from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia at U.S.
                                    higher education institutions. A number of Saudi women are reporting that their
                                    graduate educational experience in the U.S. has stimulated their interest and desire
                                    to pursue entrepreneurial endeavors and/or civic activism in their home country.
                                    This finding appears to be common among the majority of participants in the study
                                    regardless of their academic discipline and personal background-- Saudi women are
                                    returning to the Kingdom with PhDs, MBAs, and other internationally-recognized
                                    credentials along with concrete plans to start their own businesses and/or involve
                                    themselves in civic activism. This paper investigates the factors that may be
                                    influencing this phenomenon, its impact on individual participants, and the possible
                                    short term and long term impacts on Saudi society, economy, and political
                                    environment as a whole.</p>
                                <p>The research study which this paper is based upon utilizes a qualitative
                                    methodological approach, specifically case study design, to collect data from nine
                                    female graduate student participants from Saudi Arabia and presents an in-depth
                                    description of each case. The analysis of the collected data has been guided by
                                    theoretical frameworks related to Arab feminism(s) and Islamic feminism(s). It is
                                    anticipated that this paper will build on and add complexity to contemporary
                                    understandings of transnational feminism(s) in a global context, with specific focus
                                    on the diverse educational experiences of Muslim women.</p>

                                <p><strong>Effectiveness of Leadership Education on Female Tertiary Muslim Students of
                                        United Arab Emirates (Joining virtually)</strong></p>
                                <p>The education level and career orientation of Muslim females have always been a
                                    matter of debate around the world. Muslim women are found less educated as compared
                                    to the women in most other religious groups and lag further behind in making their
                                    own career separated from their male partners (McClendon et al, 2018). As mentioned
                                    by Dr. Haaifa Jawaad in her book, The Rights of Women in Islam: An Authentic
                                    Approach, the Quran commands all Muslims, to read, think, contemplate, and pursue
                                    knowledge, regardless of gender, and education has been encouraged as a religious
                                    duty for both males and females by Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) (Jawaad, 1998). In spite
                                    of no restrictions from the religion side, the possible reasons for the learning gap
                                    could be the economic condition of Muslims in countries like Pakistan and India
                                    where due to lack of resources, male children get privilege. It could be the misuse
                                    of religiosity to suppress women like in Afghanistan, Iraq and Iran or the
                                    conditions of the war zone countries like Palestine and Syria.</p>
                                <p>United Arab Emirates (UAE), a fast developing country and an advocate of women’s
                                    rights and education, gives place to the people from all around the world. A typical
                                    classroom of a home to around two hundred nationalities is mostly a mixed
                                    nationality classroom. This research is an attempt to check the effectiveness of
                                    leadership education on female tertiary Muslim students of UAE. These Muslim female
                                    students will not only build up their own lives and careers but can also help
                                    females of their home countries by setting up examples in front of them. The same
                                    model can be applied to other less developed and suppressed set-ups. The study
                                    investigated the effectiveness of a student leadership program at a private college
                                    in Dubai having hundred percent female Muslim population. As a part of the course
                                    students were asked to fill the Emotionally Intelligent Leadership Inventory (EILI),
                                    2 nd edition, based on which the frequency distribution of them was determined
                                    across the Inventory. The students with good scores across nineteen capacities of
                                    EILI were interviewed to know their perception about the course to get its
                                    effectiveness.</p>

                                        Indonesian New Curriculum System&nbsp;(Joining virtually)</strong></p>
                                <p>This paper investigates misunderstandings regarding implementing HOTS in the
                                    Indonesian education system, focusing on selecting KKO (Operational Framework or
                                    verbs) in learning materials and questions by teachers through a literature review
                                    approach. The 2013 Curriculum is being replaced by the Prototype Curriculum in the
                                    Indonesian education system (Kurikulum Merdeka). This modification emphasizes
                                    students' abilities to observe their environment, solve problems, and find social
                                    solutions. By applying LOTS (Lower Order Thinking Skills) and MOTS (Middle Order
                                    Thinking Skills) towards HOTS, Bloom's Taxonomy is also used to support the Merdeka
                                    curriculum (high thinking skills). However, HOTS is misunderstood in the national
                                    curriculum. The Merdeka curriculum proposes the implementation and application of
                                    hierarchical HOTS to increase students' skills and competencies. Ministry of
                                    Education and Culture directives govern KKO and HOTS-based learning questions.
                                    Teachers struggle to develop instructional materials, and students struggle to
                                    answer HOTS questions. It becomes problematic when policymakers regulate HOTS with
                                    teacher obstacles.</p>
                                <p>According to experts in Bloom's Taxonomy, efforts to improve classroom learning
                                    frequently fail. Bloom's Taxonomy prohibits the teaching of "high-level" tasks
                                    before "lower-order" tasks. The mastery of simple tasks must precede that of complex
                                    ones. Students who struggle with Knowledge (C1) and Comprehension (C2) should not be
                                    taught "higher-order" concepts first. Knowledge (C4) must be mastered before
                                    Synthesis (C5). Complex individual abilities with variable comprehension and
                                    practice levels are inapplicable to HOTS leveling. We propose to deconstruct the
                                    understanding and application of Bloom's Taxonomy for the reconstruction of HOTS in
                                    terms of the subject developed by the teacher; (1) rather than assuming that a
                                    "higher-order" task will always be more complicated than a "lower-order" task, the
                                    teacher can change almost all levels of questions by decreasing the difficulty (but
                                    not the level); (2) rather than assuming that "higher-order" results necessitate
                                    "higher-order" learning tasks, teachers should focus on how students learn. Inviting
                                    students to engage with "higher-order" learning materials actively is the solution;
                                    and (3) since critical thinking (evaluative) is the correct way of thinking, it is
                                    crucial to increase students' understanding while enhancing their abilities. Not
                                    only can this taxonomy be used mechanically based on its fundamental understanding,
                                    but it can also be developed and explained further based on the context of the
                                    subject matter. To avoid Bloom's Taxonomy paradox plaguing the Indonesian
                                    educational system, all levels of cognitive ability may be used to complete tasks.

                                <p>Situated within the context of the international discourse on Global Citizenship
                                    Education (GCE) and given the research gap on its theorization and application in
                                    North Africa and the Middle East, this study uses English as a Foreign Language
                                    (EFL) textbooks as a context for deepening the conceptualizations of Global
                                    Citizenship Education. As a new educational model, GCE advocates for the need to
                                    cultivate global citizenship; it implies global interconnectedness, solidarity, and
                                    commitment to the common good beyond the national borders (Torres, 2015; Torres
                                    &amp; Bosio, 2020).</p>
                                <p>Algeria, among other Maghrebi countries, opted for the expansion of EFL education due
                                    to its worldwide dominance as the language of science and technology. Although
                                    English came to impose itself at the international level as a hegemonic language
                                    (Zughoul, 2003), its “anonymity” (Woolard, 2016) as a language that is not forced by
                                    any former colonial power contributed to its prosperity in the Algerian context
                                    compared to the French language.</p>
                                <p>The dominance of EFL also poses a challenge pertaining to the cultural content of the
                                    curriculum taught in national contexts with public institutions that prescribe the
                                    “official knowledge” (Apple, 2014). Using Guilherme’s (2007) words, it gives rise to
                                    the challenge of tailoring the teaching of EFL in a way to avoid “ethnocentric”
                                    nationalistic approach and “ethno-cleansing” Eurocentric approach towards an
                                    unbiased “ethno-decentring” approach for the cultivation of global citizens (p.80).
                                    In fact, the actualization of this question in practice remains an open-ended
                                    conversation especially in contexts with strong nationalistic ideologies. Using EFL
                                    standardized textbooks that are published from 2016 through 2019 and used around
                                    junior high public schools in Algeria, this paper seeks to address the following
                                    questions: (1) What are the dominant ideologies that are communicated through texts
                                    and images of Algerian junior high EFL textbooks? (2) In what ways, if any, do texts
                                    and images of Algerian junior high EFL textbooks contribute to fostering global
                                    citizenship identity?</p>
                                <p>This study is guided by Freire’s concept of “praxis”, i.e., “reflection and action
                                    upon the world in order to transform it” (1970, p.51). Thus, using a critical
                                    framework, I draw on the different tools that are offered by Critical Discourse
                                    Analysis, Social Semiotics Theory, and Multimodality to unveil the different
                                    ideologies embedded in the content of the EFL textbooks in Algeria. The Multimodal
                                    Critical Discourse Analysis that is used in this study is based on the functional
                                    model developed by Halliday (1978) in the field of linguistics, namely the
                                    metafunction of language that deals with the content and the interpersonal
                                    metafunction of language that is about social relationships. The study will derive
                                    from the tools developed by different critical scholars to accommodate the analysis
                                    of different linguistic forms and visual structures of the textbooks (e.g., Machin
                                    &amp; Mayr, 2012; Leeuwen, 2012; Kress &amp; Van Leeuwen, 2006).</p>

                                    religious/madrassa education system in Pakistan, as reflected through policy text
                                    using the framework and method of Jager’s Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA).</p>
                                <p>Pakistan being one of the few countries founded on the basis of religion, has a
                                    dialectical relation between religion and other social institutes. The nature,
                                    magnitude, and modalities of these relations vary across institutes, geographies,
                                    and time. The relation between religion and schooling/education is a critical one,
                                    for both have been trying to develop a functioning equilibrium since the inception
                                    of Pakistan. Embedded within the very fabric of society, Islam features heavily in
                                    politics of Pakistan, which is evident from constitutional provisions and
                                    faith-based political parties. Islam being an integral component of all political
                                    agendas, features in political slogans/campaigns, and is used as a legitimation tool
                                    for any and every social action from individual to national level. This overarching
                                    nature of religion/Islam, and its influence over politics, has implications for
                                    education policy making in Pakistan, as policy making, and education are inherently
                                    political activities.</p>
                                <p>This paper uses Jager’s framework, which draws upon Foucault’s work, by incorporating
                                    Leonet’ev’s activity theory. Jager’s methodology mediates Foucault’s method by
                                    introducing social actors as a missing link between discourse and reality, subject
                                    and object, and discursive and non-discursive practices. This approach uses Laclau’s
                                    social constructivism to introduce a dualism of discourse and reality, therefore,
                                    denying existence of any social reality outside discourse. Jager’s framework, thus,
                                    allows us to analyze policy text as a social action which is reflective of power
                                    structures that (re)produces the madrassa education system in Pakistan.</p>
                                <p>Through an in depth structural, detailed, and synoptic analysis, policy texts around
                                    madrassa education system reveal temporal and spatial trends in power of, and over,
                                    madrassa education system in Pakistan. The analysis also reveals differences across
                                    various democratic and military regimes, along with shifts in power structures as a
                                    result of geopolitical shifts. Other findings include, argumentation shifts across
                                    policies and assuming a coherent version of Islam. There are generic prescriptions
                                    about Islamic education which circumvents, legitimizes, and problematizes the
                                    sectarian differences within Islamic education.</p>
                                <p>Furthermore, the philosophical and practical dissonance between modern/worldly and
                                    Islamic education is a common feature within policy texts. Both are clearly
                                    demarcated as different, and almost all policies try to present a unifying link and
                                    coherence between the two. These mitigation attempts almost always use the rhetoric
                                    of Quran and Hadith for legitimation purposes. This is indicative of the strength of
                                    the discourse, which imbues the madrassa education system with its power. This paper
                                    is an attempt to develop a holistic understanding of the madrassa education system
                                    in Pakistan, unlike most scholarship, which look at the economic and social
                                    ramifications of the phenomenon. This paper ends with a few recommendations to
                                    better understand and address the dissonance between the public and madrassa
                                    education systems.</p>

                                        Educational Stakeholders in Mauritius&nbsp;(Joining virtually)</strong></p>
                                <p>It is undeniable that human values are key in shaping the youth into responsible
                                    citizens capable of making a positive difference to peoples’ life, and facing
                                    global, national, and personal challenges. According to Carneiro et al. (2021),
                                    religion has an important role in the development of such values and eventually on
                                    moral and ideal behaviors. Though several studies have been done in this field to
                                    correlate religion and human values, analysis of the literature revealed that (i)
                                    most of the studies are limited to few human values, (ii) there is no published
                                    article showcasing the correlation in the Mauritian context, (iii) an Islamic
                                    perspectives has not yet been adopted in analysing the correlations, in view of
                                    planning trainings that will further the development of values in students of the
                                    Muslim community, (iv) are limited to simple statistical correlations. It is in this
                                    perspective that the Mauritius-specific data from the AEMS “Mapping the Terrains”
                                    project was used to investigate the correlation between religion and a broad set of
                                    human values, namely forgiveness, individualistic orientation, collectivistic
                                    orientation, self-efficacy, problem-solving, meaning-making, sense of belongingness,
                                    religiosity and spirituality, hope, life satisfaction, gratitude, emotion,
                                    regulation, empathy, and self-regulation.</p>
                                <p>In fact, using a purely quantitative methodology, the data from the AEMS “Mapping the
                                    Terrains” project were analysed using the SPSS and AMOS software to develop a (i)
                                    descriptive analysis, which showcase the association between the main religious
                                    beliefs in Mauritius (Muslim, Christian and Hindu) and the key human values, and
                                    (ii) Structural Equation Model (SEM) which showcases the existing correlations
                                    between religion and the set of human values. In fact, the output of this study,
                                    which maps the different human values to the main religious beliefs present in the
                                    Mauritian community, represents important baseline data that inform policymakers and
                                    other educational stakeholders on the way forward to further the development of
                                    human values amongst Mauritian students and other educational stakeholders.
                                    Moreover, by adopting an Islamic perspective to analyse the findings of the study,
                                    it was found that the Muslim community in Mauritius have greater likelihood and are
                                    more agreeable towards most of the values as compared to the other communities,
                                    excluding forgiveness, life satisfaction, individualistic orientation,
                                    self-efficacy, and problem solving. In fact, this article also provides a set of
                                    recommendations (prepared based on the findings of this study) that inform policy
                                    makers and other educational specialists on the way forward to enhance the
                                    development of human values amongst students of different religions, depending on
                                    their specific needs. This will provide healthy values-based multi-cultural and
                                    multi-ethnic relationships between the different ethnic groups of the country.</p>

                                        Moderating Mechanism&nbsp;(Joining virtually)</strong></p>
                                <p>A sense of belonging is a critical part of healthy human development. In recent
                                    times, educational researchers have investigated how a sense of belonging at school
                                    affects students in multifaceted ways. Yet known studies have not explored this
                                    construct and its outcomes in Muslim societies. The impact of a sense of belonging
                                    on forgiveness and gratitude remains an area that requires more attention in Muslim
                                    societies. Drawing on the need to belong theory, our study tested the mediating role
                                    of collectivism between a sense of belonging and forgiveness &amp; gratitude. We
                                    also examined the moderating role of religiosity/ spirituality between a sense of
                                    belonging and collectivism. This research paper presents findings from a
                                    quantitative study of 2019-2020 “Mapping the Terrain” conducted by the International
                                    Institute of Islamic Thought (IIIT). The data on values and competencies were
                                    collected in fifteen communities of interest, namely Muslim-majority societies with
                                    a focus on students in secondary schools and higher education (n= 13492). Data is
                                    analyzed using SPSS and SmartPLS. Young people under 18 (65%) are the largest target
                                    group, followed by 18-24 year old (32%) in 15 countries. The adult sample is highly
                                    educated, with the majority of students (18%) having a bachelor's degree. The
                                    largest sample (n=2,216) was collected from India, while the smallest sample was
                                    from the United States (n=252). The results reveal that demographic characteristics
                                    such as age and gender positively impact forgiveness, while negatively impacting
                                    gratitude, collectivism, and religiosity. There is a negative relationship between
                                    age and a sense of belonging. There is no significant difference in forgiveness
                                    based on grade. The results also indicate that sense of belonging is positively
                                    associated with forgiveness &amp; gratitude, and that collectivism mediates all of
                                    these relationships. Religiosity doesn’t moderate the relationship between a sense
                                    of belonging and collectivism. Based on the results of our analysis, we have
                                    recommended policies to government and non-government institutions for improving
                                    their recruitment, training and development processes using values profile.</p>

                                <p>The Muslims in India have been at a vulnerable position in the last one decade due to
                                    the political climate. The structural and religious oppression has the potential to
                                    trigger violence and riots due to its vulnerability of being a land divided into
                                    nations on the grounds of religion. The Muslims of India are reminded of having
                                    secondary status and added with negative derogatory identity labels by the
                                    majoritarian right-wing group. The present study looked at how does this
                                    socio-political oppression is perceived by the Muslim youth and whether it has
                                    effects on their religiosity, moral values, and sense of belongingness. The
                                    difference between religiosity and values of empathy and forgiveness in teachers and
                                    Muslims students are worth exploring to understand whether the two generations
                                    differ in the context of political oppressions. The hypothesis is that despite the
                                    experiences of religious oppressions, the Muslim Youth maintains their religiosity
                                    and values of empathy and forgiveness hold them non-violent. The connectedness
                                    between religiosity and sense-of belongingness is further analyzed to support the
                                    hypothesis.</p>

                                <p>Students' sense of belonging to school is an important research topic because when
                                    students feel like they are a part of a school community, they are more likely to
                                    perform better academically, be more motivated to learn, and have higher
                                    self-esteem. Using the survey data collected in 2019-2020 for Advancing Education in
                                    Muslim Societies (AEMS), this study examines differences between countries in the
                                    strength of students’ sense of belonging at school and differences in students'
                                    perception of teachers , and how they are associated with students’ type of school

                                        &nbsp;A Survey-based Global Study.&nbsp;(Joining virtually)</strong></p>
                                <p>The data for this exploratory study will come from the Mapping the Terrain 2018-2019
                                    study. The project includes the dataset to expand the sample in all age groups. I
                                    particularly intend to use all Muslims in the survey. I will consider both
                                    Muslim-majority countries, including Bosnia, Indonesia, Jordan, Kyrgyzstan, Morocco,
                                    Tanzania, Bangladesh, Algeria, Sudan and Malaysia; and predominately non-Muslim
                                    countries, or countries with a balanced ratio of religions, including Tatarstan,
                                    India, Kenya, Mauritius, and the United States. The goal is to empirically analyze
                                    the influence of collectivistic and individualistic orientation of Muslims’
                                    self-perceived personality traits of empathy, forgiveness, gratitude, and life
                                    satisfaction.</p>
                                <p>Several scholarly researches have analyzed the role of collectivistic and
                                    individualistic orientation (Burton et al., 2021; Mishra, 1994), and how they impact
                                    individuals’ self-perceived positive psychological traits of empathy (Duan, Wei
                                    &amp; Wang, 2008), forgiveness (Hook et al., 2012), gratitude (Rego &amp; Cunha,
                                    2009), and community mindfulness (Germani et al., 2021). However, this will be among
                                    the first empirical studies to analyze a large, global sample of Muslims. Based on
                                    past literature and considering the information gap, this study will answer the
                                    following research question:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Does collectivistic or individualistic orientation among Muslims impact the
                                        level of their empathy, forgiveness, and community mindfulness differently?</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>This research question will be answered by a series of individual hypotheses through
                                    regression analysis of different independent variables (collectivistic and
                                    individualistic orientations) and dependent variables (empathy, forgiveness, and
                                    community mindfulness) while controlling for survey participant geographic location
                                    (including Bosnia, Indonesia, Jordan, Kyrgyzstan, Morocco, Tanzania, Bangladesh,
                                    Algeria, Sudan and Malaysia; Tatarstan, India, Kenya, Mauritius, and the United
                                    States), socioeconomic demographics (age, education and, income) and
                                    religiosity/spirituality.</p>
                                <p>An additional aspect to see here would be if the country of origin, Muslim majority
                                    vs Muslim minority, has a different outcome for the same personality orientation.
                                    Another important predicter could be gender, as men and women have shown different
                                    levels of empathy, forgiveness, and community mindfulness under the same
                                    circumstances. Other variables of interest include age, education and income.</p>

                                <p>This presentation will discuss the outcomes of a pilot study to explore perspectives
                                    of intercultural competence by Pakistani English secondary school teachers. Pakistan
                                    is implementing a Single National Curriculum with student outcomes of global
                                    citizenship including development of empathy, tolerance, gender equity, and
                                    promotion of diversity of cultures. Through a qualitative research study, three
                                    Pakistani English teachers were interviewed to explore their perspectives of
                                    intercultural competence. This study is relevant to explore intercultural competence
                                    as a framework to effectively support the new curricular outcomes. Key findings
                                    included: a need for developing intercultural competence in Pakistani public
                                    schools; a lack of professional development programs in intercultural competence; a
                                    broad understanding of its meaning; and the positive role of cultural exchange in
                                    its development. This study adds to the field of international research by providing
                                    a foundation for development of purposeful teacher education programs through the
                                    framework of intercultural competence. Furthermore, it will help identify
                                    intersections in terminology and a broader understanding of non-western perspectives
                                    of intercultural competence.</p>

                                    increase in hate crimes against this vilified demographic. Muslim American youth
                                    experience a distinct marginalization experience as part of their lived reality.
                                    This lived experience is one of challenges and resilience, invalidation and
                                    strength, as Muslim Americans navigate their intersectional realities with
                                    hyphenations and multiplicities of identity at play (Sirin &amp; Fine, 2008).
                                    Critical Race Theory has been used first as a legal theoretical framework, and later
                                    found application in the educational experiences of minoritized populations. Subsets
                                    of Critical Race Theory have included LatCrit, TribalCrit, AsianCrit, FemCrit,
                                    QueerCrit and the like, each carving a niche for its demographic's specific
                                    experience. The creation of subsets within an academic framework, do more than
                                    creating a space, they also enable the tool of language to be established and used
                                    in a discussion that can be based on certain inherent assumptions. As a female,
                                    Muslim American, I have felt that such a space needed to be given for an exploration
                                    of the Muslim American experience, which while being intersectional is one situated
                                    in a narrative of demonization by the mainstream White. White control over the
                                    narrative of Muslim Americans either creates a story of oppression of Muslims by
                                    other Muslims, or spins a tale of terrorism. This article is centered around a
                                    narrative inquiry of 15 female Muslim American students around how they have
                                    navigated both Muslim and non-Muslim educational spaces in the United States. The
                                    study considers the formal and informal educational experiences of Muslim American
                                    high school and undergraduate female students including public and Islamic
                                    schooling, the role of family, and Muslim Student Association on Muslim American
                                    youth.</p>

                                        Methods&nbsp;(Joining virtually)</strong></p>
                                <p>The belief in one's own ability to perform a specific task or behavior is referred to
                                    as self-efficacy. It is a central concept that correlates strongly and positively
                                    with cognitive and behavioral engagement in a given task. In an education
                                    based-environment, students’ success is driven by their academic and engagement
                                    performance. Students with high self-efficacy also participate more in class, work
                                    harder, persevere longer, and have fewer negative emotional reactions when faced
                                    with difficulties compared to students with low self-efficacy. The goal of this
                                    study is to investigate and understand students' self-efficacy in Muslim societies.
                                    To achieve the goal of this study, factor analysis is performed to understand the
                                    underlying structure of a survey dataset followed by developing predictive models
                                    using machine learning methods. This study seeks to predict student self-efficacy
                                    (SSE) using a set of factors that represent different dimensions, such as
                                    psychological competencies, values, socioeconomic, and religious predictors.</p>
                                <p>The survey dataset—used in this study—was collected and provided by the International
                                    Institute of Islamic Thought as part of an initiative on advancing education and
                                    human development in Muslim communities. There is a lack of studies on students'
                                    self-efficacy in Muslim societies, which have unique values systems and face
                                    critical development challenges. The outcome of this study will further advance the
                                    body of knowledge in educational research and potentially benefit researchers and
                                    educators with a focus on Muslim societies. Academic and other educators from other
                                    societies could also use the findings of this study to identify students with low or
                                    high levels of self-efficacy and to develop self-efficacy improvement interventions.
